# React Native Flexbox Example

This is a basic React Native app that demonstrates the use of Flexbox for creating a responsive layout with card-like elements. Items are displayed in rows with wrapping when they exceed the container's width.


## Description

- The app displays a list of green cards in rows, with wrapping enabled, so that cards move to the next row if they exceed the container's width.
- Each card has a fixed width, height, and margin for spacing.


## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Expo CLI (if using Expo)
